Inspired by the work of Fred Eerdekenz and other typographers working with lighting effects, I designed a typeface based off of Helvetica that would use light and shadow to "write" the strokes.  

I used Zbrush to construct a slab with the alphabet carved into the face. All strokes are debossed save for the verticals, which aren't present. Assuming the light source is shining from near the top of the slab, extruding pegs of varying heights can cast shadows down the face of the slab and create the missing vertical strokes.  

After printing the 3D model, I brought the file into WebGL to demonstrate how it works. The webpage has two perspectives of the model: one vertical and one horizontal (both respond slightly differently to the light source). A single spotlight rotates around the scene to create the shadows. Additionally, I created a plane with a changing color function to add some visual interest to the scene and catch the shadows that the models were casting.
